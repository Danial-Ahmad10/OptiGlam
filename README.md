# Skin Tone Detection Project

## Abstract
This project focuses on the development of a skin tone detection system using machine learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It aims to accurately categorize diverse skin tones across different racial groups and assign specific hexcodes. The system's core purpose extends to potential applications in the beauty industry, including a personalized makeup recommender system based on identified skin tones.

## Methodology
The project utilizes the Monk Skin Tone Dataset (MST Dataset) and employs advanced image preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the data for model training. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are developed and fine-tuned using TensorFlow to detect and categorize skin tones. The block diagram within this repository illustrates the logical flow of processes involved, spanning from dataset collection to skin tone detection and user interface/output.
